(just messing with you to see if you're still me).  i'ts got to be something people like to see.   something exciting for children in 5th certainly not for children in 6th.   i know what it is,  it's a couple of books,  mysteries,  adventures,  robberies with crooks.  along with that they threw in math bingo and probably the card game uno.   so that's what i think is in the 5th grade box and remember it's certainly not a fox.
