113788,My favorite car,william,5,"my favorite car is a bugatti veyron i like it because it go up to 500 mph that mean that it is very fast and i like how it look and i like how the inside and how the color go hard.  the bugatti veyron is an 8-litre,  mid engine grand touring car.  the super sport version is the fastest road-legal production car in the world with a top speed of 267 mph and was designed and developed by the volkswagen group. how would you define the most amazing production car in the world? would it be: the car with the most horsepower? the car with the fastest top speed and acceleration? the most expensive car? at the moment,  the bugatti  veyron appears to have it all:it is the most important car on the lot it cost up to 1 million dollar  a w-16 engine that can produce 1, 001 horsepower a top speed of 250+ mph (400+ kph) a zero-to-60 time of three seconds a zero-to-180 time of 14 seconds a price tag somewhere in the $1. 2 million range.  in this article,  we will take an in-depth look at this amazing automobile and see how it is possible to fit so much performance into a single machine.  it all starts with the engine. . . so let's start with the engine.  how would you begin the design process for an engine this powerful? if you have read how car engines work,  you know that if you want to create a 1, 000-horsepower engine,  it has to be able to burn enough gasoline to generate 1, 000 horsepower.  that works out to about 1. 33 gallons (5 liters) of gasoline per minute.  we need a 16-liter engine to burn 1. 33 gallons of gas per minute.  that actually makes sense -- the engine in the dodge viper is 8. 0 liters in displacement and produces 500 hp.  but there's a problem: a 16-liter v-8 engine would be very large.  and the pistons would be massive,  so there would be no way it could turn at 6, 000 rotations per minute (rpm).  it might turn at a maximum of 2, 000 rpm,  meaning that you would need an immense 48-liter engine to generate 1, 000 hp.  clearly an engine that big is impossible in a passenger car.  so how did bugatti fit 1, 000 horsepower into a passenger car? let's find out.  a bugatti is the most car that is valuable",2110,3.321381092071533,3.251492738723755,3.26858139038086
