(to her because she was very small) come in my yard.  like why or how would it even get into the street? donâ’t horses hate people and shouldnâ’t it be in a stable or a barn? as she thought about trying to answer her questions she heard the noise again from the stallion has if the stallion and she had both heard the first sound again at the same time rumbling in the 2nd garden.  then the stallion broke up to a stand as she was gazing back and forth at the stallion then at the noise as she stood confused at first trying to see what the noise was and then she realized that the noise turned out to be a big fat slimmy rat rustling in the tomato plants and the potato plants too.  then the stallion finally pawed the ground and was snorting out a thunder storm at the same time&#x85;it then closed its eyes looking at the ground frozen in the mist of sunlight in the day and then it opened its eyes in mid speed and blasted at the garden with a single breath betting the garden into bits of dust running away in the sunset as if youâ’d take one blink to look at it.                                &#x85; \t when she was woken up by her mom and dad she was told that her uncle,  ernest,  was in town and dropped by to see her with a present.  as she wondered racing down stairs as fast as she could like a cheetah running in the jungle as fast as it could to catch its prey.  \twhen she reached the bottom steep she saw her uncle,  ernest (or ernie as she called him),  was waiting at the front door.  when she ran up to hug him she noticed something that he never usually brought to visit them,  he brought his horse stable carrier that carries horses when you need to go somewhere,  but there wasnâ’t just 4 horses,  but now there was 5 horses this time.  \ternie said, â“ this one i found a stray out in the street taking a mornin stroll, â” he said, â” and it was sleeping a little while after i came back so,  i snuck behind it and pushed it into my trailer so it got a little nervous and started wining at me,  but finally it went into the trailer and before it could think or turn around i snatched it into the trailer and here i am here. â” he said in an exciting voice. â“ so i want to know if you will take him because i donâ’t have enough room for him and because you lost your horse and are not looking forward to getting one and by the way you have all that room why not take this one as your birthday present. â” he said with a long pause after and then he whispered her something in her ear so her parents wouldnâ’t hear.   after he was done talking she went to the horse to pet it in the stable,  but before she could even get her hand into the stable the stallion tried to stick itâ’s head out and tried to bite her,  but she thought fast and pulled away as fast as she could and then she fell over because her arm was swinging around after she pulled from the bite and fell completely down hard as a rock on her face.      \t\t\t\t\t&#x85;  when she woke up she was in her bed and saw that see was knocked out from how hard the fall was.  then she rolled over to the other side of the bed and stared at the time and found out that she was knocked out from 10:07 to 4:39.  that was 5hours and 68minutes she had been a sleep! \tafter a couple of minutes her mom came into the room and was bringing up a tray of food for her daughter and looked up to see how she was going and when she saw her daughter wide awake she dropped the tray,  of food and ran over to her daughter and put her hands on the little girlsâ’ cheeks and kissed her about a dozen times.  then looked up to the little girls face and said with a very frantic tone, â“ iâ’ve missed you so much that i almost fainted!â” then she said a little bit quiet that she took her tone and pulled it down to a whisper, â“ you have a bruise on your head you pore thing.  are you hurt?
