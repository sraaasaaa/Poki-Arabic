109028,Not a poem,nathan,8,"\ti wish i had integrity.  integrity is not just being truthful while people's backs are turned; it's doing the right thing all the time.  it is telling the truth.  it is being helpful.  it is respecting yourself and others.  that is only a few steps to having integrity.  \tintegrity is to be free of people watching you every second of your life.  my scout master mr.  negron has a business called integron.  integron stands for integrity,  and negron.  he put those two words together and it meant that his business has integrity.  he has told me that not everyone is perfect,  but everyone has to have a little integrity.  he asked me if i had integrity but i could not answer.  that is why i need integrity.  without integrity this world would be a mess.  i for one i am trying to have integrity.  with your heart,  your mind,  and someone's help you can work on having integrity.    \ti plan on pushing out those bad habits,  impulses,  bad ideas,  schemes,  and any other thing that i do in my life.  some steps in having integrity would be to focus on school work,  chores,  following rules,  being nice,  and paying attention every day.  it will be hard but i know i can do it.  it takes a lot of effort doing things the right way,  but when you do the things in the right way you feel good.  i have to stop lying to everybody and tell the truth so i can do fun things,  and hang out with friends,  and not stay home moping in my room.  it will be worth all the effort.  \thaving integrity is a big thing in life.  many people don't know this.  it keeps life balanced along with a lot of other things.  i will have integrity soon.  it will be in my life until in die.  you do not need bold words,  or a good heart to have integrity.  all you really need is to be truthful,  helpful,  happy,  and respect others.  then your life is better than ever.  \ta person that has integrity helps others.  the one thing that you need to do in order to have integrity is believe in yourself.   integrity means lots of things not just one.  it means being truthful,  brave,  friendly,  kind,  thrifty,  and clean minded.   like i said before (integrity is not just being truthful while people's backs are turned; it's doing the right thing all the time. ) so do what's right,  make a spot in your life for integrity.
