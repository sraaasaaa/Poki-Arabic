112849,Jack (and jill) and the Beanstalk,peyton,7,"jack and jill go up the hill but they donâ’t come tumbling down,  it happens different you will see- it all started in a town.  jack and jill were poor and ill,  seeking for something to trade,  but after a while of searching for miles,  their hope began to fade.  just then a man who ran a stand,  noticed jack and jill,  he took their weeds and gave them seeds,  then told them to run up that hill.  well jack and jill,  naã¯ve still,  listened to the man,  they hurried quick right out of town and ran and ran and ran.  when jack and jill reached the hill,  they went right to that well,  what they found inside,  was quite a surprise-just a small seed and its shell.  â“how dare that man try to trick us like that?â” jill began to cry,  the well that should have water was completely dry.  jack got so mad,  so very mad; he threw the seeds they found,  just then it started to rain and rain,  falling upon the ground.  jack and jill,  soaking still,  noticed the wee little seed,  it shook a little on the ground then sprouted a large green weed.  but it didnâ’t stop there,  it continued to grow taller than most of the trees,  if you saw this beanstalk you would know itâ’s something you never see.  jack and jill,  desperate still,  thought maybe the man was right,  so they climbed on up the beanstalk fast,  boy was it a sight! when they got to the top,  their dreams came true for it was a land of food,  it was huge of course with tons of meals,  but the kids didnâ’t want to be rude.  jack and jill,  polite still,  knocked on all the doors,  but nobody came out; there was no noise,  except for lots of snores.  jack and jill,  hungry still,  followed the annoying noise,  they found a house,  and opened the door and found lots of girls and boys! they were trapped in ropes the size of&#x85;well ropes&#x85; that were really big,  and what they saw next was very weird; again it was enormous and big.  a giant slept inside a bed snoring really loud,  but among all the mess,  jack and jill,  saw their friends inside the crowd.  hansel and gretel were all tied up,  shh-ing all around,  they didnâ’t want the giant to wake up- for jack and jill to be found.  jack and jill,  puzzled still,  wondered why they were tied up,  so hansel and gretel in,  in a very small voice,  explained why madness erupt.  far from the town up in the sky,  a magic bird was found,   it was very happy there,  you see,  and it layed golden eggs on the ground.  but soon the people of the town became greedy and looked for the bird,  the people searched everywhere up and down,  but it wasnâ’t seen or heard.  so of the children that climbed on up the winding,  tall,  green stalk,  the giant made them slaves to find the bird-they couldnâ’t ever talk.  but still,  they never found the bird,  and to this very day,  the giant makes them search and search-here is where they stay.  the only way the children will be freed,  is to find that magic bird,  but no person has ever seen it-no person has ever heard.  when hansel and gretel had finished their tale they looked so very sad,  jack and jill,  worried still,  knew the giant was bad.  and even though they were very scared,  jack and jill volunteered,  they would find that magic bird,  and travel the journey feared.  they snuck up to the kitchen to find some food that they would need for the trip,  then they put on their boots for the long walk,  a step they could not skip.  after the siblings said their goodbyes,  they headed out the door,  but when they got outside they remembered they needed something more.  a map of course! ,  is what they need to get around the town,  so they went on looking all around,  for someone in the town.  just as the two were about to give up,  they heard a quiet sigh,  and as they approached the girl in red,  she began to cry.  â“whatâ’s wrong?â” asked gretel in a caring tone,  â“iâ’m just looking for a mapâ”,  then the girl sat up and smiled as if they had walked into her trap.  â“iâ’m all aloneâ”,  replied the girl â“will you come and stay with me?â” â“i have no map but surely iâ’m as friendly as can be!â” â“sorry but we have to goâ”,  said jill,  now afraid,  but little red riding hood seemed completely careless that this isnâ’t where they stayed.  she asked where they were going and jack said â“the birdâ”,  so red had to go with them when she heard that very word.  of course she knew the town and the way they had to go,  so she led them up the nearest mountain that was slightly covered in snow.  but wait- this snow wasnâ’t even snow,  they were diamonds shining bright,  â“donâ’t touch themâ”,  said red riding hood,  â“for this is the mountain of snow white\tâ“.  for a boy who grew up with nothing at all jack picked up just one,  but he quickly froze into a statue of ice and now the damage was done.  for the next whole day of the girlsâ’ frightening trip,  jill cried her heart out with a trembling lip.  but she quickly stopped on the following day when she smelled a delightful smell,  it was a river full of chocolate that was flowing from a well.  â“tricky treat river-donâ’t drink from the flow!â” but jill learned her lesson from the mountain of snow.  finally they came to a golden path except the bricks were&#x85;eggs! there were so many that when you walked,  they come up to your legs.  this must be where the bird lived and this was proven true,  the girls saw it just sitting there and it looked so very blue.  jill wen to pick up the bird but behind her she heard a sound,  red had grown sharp teeth and her head had turned around! â“ah-ha! youâ’ve fallen for my trick-iâ’m the golden birdâ’s keeper,  i need to rid of any thieves so i made the egg laying deeper.  soon you were supposed to drown but a problem in my plan,  the bird has stopped laying its egg and that is why i ranâ”.  as jill was sinking through the eggs she knew just what to do,  sheâ’d sing the song her parents sang when she had had the flu: â“though you be sick,  or hurt or ill,  you are still strong,  powerful still.  deep in your heart your powers will glow,  and soon you will see,  the brightness will show. â” red was furious and growing weak for she tried to stop the song,  but it was too late- red had shriveled and she was already gone.  jill rose right out of the eggs,  and the bird began laying from between its legs.  the curse was broken and all lives came back,  including the townspeople and of course- jack.  jack and jill rejoiced and they took the bird to town,  here,  everyone was grateful-not a single frown.  and as they came back to the giantâ’s room,  they saw he was gone and the ropes were too.  the children were free and could roam about-their parents had returned as well,  so jack and jill,  homesick still,  went home for a story to tell.  their family liked the town above so they decided to move right away,  and so jack and jill,  heroic still,  knew that they should stay.
