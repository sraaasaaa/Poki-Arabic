34562,I Believe,sonia,10,"the past has gone once again and the present has taken its place.  living in a world of deception is one of the hardest effects to face.   traveling from one location to another can make life so desperate.  what is the point of all this,  when we just get an increased view called the hypocrite?   but a new destination and goals arrive just by dragging the head.     disposing pieces of energy all in the respect of going from blue to red.   already being a red but living in a blue can make the mind feel illegal.  everyday experiencing nothing but lower cast and discrimination of not being an equal.                                                                                                                                                               it isn't the easiest thing,  but how can we resist it when there is no other choice.  this was the place where,  only the first voice of life could be heard,  and to carry on life always feeling so moist.   being uncontrollable of how ones' fait can be destined can sometimes be such a tragedy.  because no matter how much the positive side one hangs on to,  everything stays the same in reality.   but now a red going to unite with the other reds,  can make matters even worse instead of being delighted.  although transferring to an area of the same type,  can create no more than an empty mind constantly trying to be highlighted.   not knowing the language,  tradition,  culture and environment makes one imitate those who stand still and do nothing more.  for what could one do when all their moments were only acknowledged by the blues in a whole new world with different rules of sore.   being locked up in a cage once more because the judgment of the reds can be so disappointing.  finally after years of coming back all to be received are just critical responses only being discouraging.   the more harder we try,  the more the reds mock.  because as they say we do not speak the mother's tongue and insult us until we wish to become a hawk.   to the red's what only matters is whether who's better or not.  the fact never changes,  it's back to the start where one feels put out of place and exists only like a dot.   once again,  when in doubt if life will be over soon,  and want to talk,  cry and scream,  it is impossible.  all is needed is a sister,  but where is she,  nowhere to be seen because there is no history which makes everything unjustifiable.   when turned to the person who's role is to care about the children,  only does nothing but make you wish you were never left alone with her.  and then there's the older male who is suppose to act and talk more intelligent but obviously there's nothing more to achieve from him than a cats per.    the other male who's fully grown and couldn't take the crazy world he was brought in,  thought the only solution was to strive on his own and who knows what outrageous things are on his mind,  maybe he's walking on some cane.  though the head of the family is the only one who shows he cares proved he is the only one sane.   now that the reds have finally returned to their kingdom,  they are only greeted with cruelty.  from the maternal's side,  they are only here to take advantage and wreck the moments of loyalty.   while the same goes from the paternal side,  all that can be seen is betrayal and dishonour.  so you can see that i am really lost in a world of deception and depression trying to earn some honour.   but no matter what,  i still survived,  even through the toughest situations,  i kept my head up high.  after autumn when the leaves fall,  comes spring when the blossoms bloom and the weeds die.   because what a family does and says isn't what really counts,  but what does is the love they give and the smiles they put across a face to make happiness with the heart.  instead of being miserable,  i've learned to be thankful of so much more,  like the house i have and the friend who acts like a real sister,  for she is the one who creates the art.   all around,  all i could ever see were the painful experiences,  but i learned to conquer them all.   because life is just a game and to win all we have to do is know all the rules and achive the goal.   i believe one day,  i will be accepted as an equal and be respected like another as long as i pray to god and cope.  it doesn't matter where ever you are,  life can always change if you will,  for there's always hope. . .

's in iraq,  or the two people who are m. i. a. 's? does that mean we are doing well in this war if we have hostages and people missing? i don't think so,  why did we have to go and wreck spring? what happened to the simple beauty of nature? what happened to people exchanging their sour moods for smiles? what happened to shedding our coats for t-shirts? what happened to the fresh spring air we used to breathe? where did all of these things go? i'll tell you what happened,  we went to war with iraq,  now we have been at war for six days,  what have we accomplished from all this? did we learn nothing from our past mistakes,  did we not see what we did in vietnam was horribly wrong? what's wrong with our president,  did he not see the gray areas that came with the war in vietnam? apparently not,   did he not see how the people in the u. s.  protested their own soldiers? did he not see the war torn vietnam veteran who returned from the horrors of war,  and they were only thirty years old,  what has happened to our nation? is anybody pro-peace? i don't know anymore,  i have an opinion,  and i think this war is wrong,  but alas,  i'm only a seventeen-year-old girl with an opinon and nothing more,  no one else cares that this war is going to tear our country apart,  i don't know what to think anymore,  in this time of war during springtime,  no one realizes what irreparable damage this war will have on us,  in this time of war and springtime.

120398,The Truth In My Thoughts,josephine,11,"depression really is an interesting thing.  you see people laugh at it,  but they don't really realize how deadly it is.  you see,  depression can come out of nothing.  there are at times that people are actually having fun with friends,  then all of the sudden they can't even smile.  you see,  depression is like seeing a baby,  anything being left by its mother.  you get this rush of dopamine in your brain,  because wow! look at that adorable baby! but when you look deeper down and take a closer look. . .  you see sadness.  and sometimes you live in it.  like a baby kangaroo in its mother's pouch.  some people get medication for their condition.  others can't afford it.  or don't know they even need it.  i'm the third one.  and the second one.  but i think i need to be the first one.  like my brother.  you see my life has been pretty tragic. . .  now some of you are rolling your eyes,  probably thinking,  ''oh yeah? try me.  i bet mines worse!'' well i don't know if mine is or not.  honestly,  if you look at my life from a strangers eyes,  you see a house.  a store,  clothes,  internet,  electricity,  a phone,  running water,  drinking water.  and so much more to be thankful for.  but if you look through my eyes or my friends and relatives,  you see a girl who lost her grandmother,  who was her best friend,  at the age of eleven.  a girl who almost lost her father at the age of twelve.  only to have him live,  but find there are harder days ahead.  with skin cancer,  which was removed,  but before that could happen he would stay in a coma for two weeks,  the hospital for so long his daughter lost count.  then finally,  get an emergency transplant to save his life,  and hopefully do some corrections to the poor life decisions he's made.  only to be later on bit in the but by another condition called diabetes,  to once again remind him of the decisions he's made.  a year later,  you would see the girls second oldest brother be diagnosed with a disease that makes the blood vessels in his hands constrict,  and this seems so little from what happened before,  but it just makes her think,  ''this may just be the beginning. '' oh,  how she wishes she were wrong,  only to be shown she's entirely right.  because a couple years later her oldest brother would be diagnosed with depression.  and she'll realize that the happiest people have the darkest minds.  she'll learn this again when her childhood best friend,  who moved away when she was going into 4th grade,  admits a history of self harm.  and once again when her other childhood best friend,  the one that made them the three musketeers,  admits to domestic violence in his home.  and again when her little cousin,  the one who grew up just a town away,  but seemed to always be only seconds away,  admits to having of thought of suicide. . .  and almost pulled it off,  thankfully that didn't happen thanks to the kid who had been hit by his father so many times he lost count.  but mostly she'll learn that she was right when she's six-teen.  and her mother will tell her that she was diagnosed with at least four types of cancer.  leading to days and nights of no sleep and no focus.  on particular night will always come to mind.  when she woke up to her mother getting sick.  she lays in bed thinking that her dad will hear and help,  because that's his job.  she'll sit there for a couple of minutes until her dad finally comes out.  she thinks,  ''finally,  i can get some rest. '' until her dad walks past her mom to go to the bathroom.  ''okay,  when he gets out he'll help. '' she thinks to herself.  until he comes out and goes back into his bedroom only after saying goodnight to his daughter.  then she'll work up the courage and go out there.  and as she helps her mother,  she'll read a text her mother sent to her father,  saying,  ''help'' you see,  that's when she loses it.  when she goes to school she wont be able to concentrate anymore.  she'll breakdown in front of her english teacher and basketball coaches first,  then her track coach,  and archery coach.  she'll finally tell her mother what's going on.  but when her mother offers to get her help,  she'll say,  ''i don't know. '' because she really doesn't.  she doesn't know if her family can afford it.  and she really doesn't know if she needs it.  but she does know,  deep down,  she should've said yes.  because she's cried more in these past seven months,  than she has in her whole life.  she'll find out the best way to get out her feelings is to write poetry.  but she wont ever let anyone read it.  it'll just sit in a book until she throws it away,  or until she moves it,  or someone finds it.  she'll secretly want someone to find it.  but she'll dread the day.  because even though she know she needs help,  she doesn't know how to ask for it.  or to accept it.  she doesn't know how to explain her feelings.  because when she was little and would cry all the time,  she was told to stop crying and man up.  she thought her feelings were not important.  she doesn't still think that.  instead she doesn't want to tell people because she's afraid they'll see her differently.  not the strong girl she wants to be.  but the weak broken one she is.
