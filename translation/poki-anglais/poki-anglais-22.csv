''  i trudged downstairs to breakfast,  where my bad luck tagged along.  there taped up to the microwave&#x85;another note from mom:  good morning! exclamation point-she always starts out nice.  now comes the part where i get fed her motherly advice.   for breakfast,  dear,  just help yourself.  there's pizza in the fridge.   and as for soda,  choose the sprite-the coke has lost its fizz.   ''is this a dream?'' i said out loud.  ''there must be some mistake.  i'd better read that through again.  i'm only half awake. ''  i scanned the lines,  not once,  but twice.  yes,  pizza's what it said! and i could swallow that advice,  so i read on ahead:  please wear your faded jeans to school,  those low-cut ones that flare.  and use my mousse to do that sticky-up thing with your hair.   ''is she for real?'' i asked myself.  what's gotten into mom? whatever it was,  i liked it lots,  so i continued on:  about your science quiz today-the one on natural gas- just tell your teacher that's one subject you don't want to pass!  i know i didn't read that right.  i couldn't have,  no way! but there it was in black and white,  as plain as night and day.   and then it hit me,  why the change: mom hadn't lost a screw; my worry-free philosophy had finally gotten through.   her rules had changed from lame to lax-my mom was cool at last! these last few months of middle school were gonna be a blast!  i quickly read the last few lines: enjoy your day at school!
