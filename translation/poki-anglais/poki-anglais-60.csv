118192,Six Letters,brooklynn,12,"\t â“six lettersâ”   it takes six letters to wrap its hand around anyone and take their life.  they say that words have a lot of power,  but i would give up having control of writing if that one word lost its power.   life isnâ’t about controlling.    it isnâ’t about gaining ownership over someone who breaks away from dreams just to live in a bitter reality.   writing isnâ’t painful,  so why should those six letters be?  life was about racing friends down crooked sidewalks,   riding bicycles until the scrapes on our knees were unbearable,  freezing with the slight touch of a hand on our shoulders,  praying a prayer of prideful palification,  wishing a wish that wouldnâ’t end in wounding wayment.   i was taught that love is not crippling,   and that it wouldnâ’t rip the tendoning feelings from my heart.   iâ’ve seen these six letters beat people blue and make their hair fall from their head like a waterfall.   i watched the crippling chemo shatter people into broken puzzle pieces.  i have loved people who have endured,   dwelled,   suffocated,   in these six letters.   words. .  words hold so much more than just letters.   iâ’m a writer,  but that word erases me.   iâ’m a lover,  but that word hates me.   i can walk,  but that word cripples me.   love is one word worth knowing.   but what can you do,  when your love intertwines fingers with six letters?  what can you do when you canâ’t tell your loved one that theyâ’ll get better?  six letters has a name.   cancer.   let me tell you this,   if six letters were a person i would personally open up a fresh can of hope on them.   weâ’re taught that words donâ’t define who we are.  but when it comes to people who are unlucky enough to have this,   words do.   so this is for them.   donâ’t ever apologize to others,  because you didnâ’t do anything to catch this.   this is for those who have loved ones who are embracing this.  donâ’t ever believe for one second that itâ’s unbeatable.   hope is the only word that should hold ownership over anything.   let it hold ownership over you.   this is for those who have lost loved ones to this.   i would apologize.  but apologies are just understatements to how people feel.   it takes six letters to wrap itsâ’ hand around anyone and take their life.   they say that words have a lot of power,  so this is for her.   even though cancer brought her to godâ’s gates,  she beat it.   cancer is just six letters.

madison (1751-1836) served as president between 1809 and 1817  like jefferson and adams,  a man of brilliant words,  known to folks across the world â– theyâ’re read,  theyâ’re spoke,  theyâ’re heard.  he wrote our constitution which gives us guarantees â– that laws and just decisions would keep our people free.   five  james monroe (1758-1831) served as president between 1817 and 1825  this lawyer from virginia as a soldier in the war,  he fought the english redcoats,  and as president did more: he kept out europeâ’s tyrants,  forever from the shores of nearby south america â– preventing further wars.   six  john quincy adams (1767-1848) served as president between 1825 and 1829  for years right by his fatherâ’s side,  while america was formed.  he lived the ways of service â– since to patriots he was born.  he spent hard years as president like most â– but then when done,  he ran and served in congress till his last days in the sun.    seven  andrew jackson (1767-1845) served as president between 1829 and 1837  a famous western general from our second english war â– the one we call â“the eighteen twelveâ” â– in new orleans andy scored.  and when he was the president,  he let the public in to party at the white house â– like some raucous roadside inn.   eight  martin van buren (1782-1862) served as president between 1837 and 1841  like adams he served just one term,  some said â“on jacksonâ’s tails. â” his famous home â– â“old kinderhookâ” changed â“yesâ” from here to wales.  see â– every time we say â“o. k. â” we abbreviate the name of van burenâ’s home near albany â– thatâ’s martinâ’s claim to fame&#x85;!!!  nine  william henry harrison (1773-1841) served as president between march 1841 and april of 1841  this general from virginia,  fought indians and earned the name â– â“tippecanoeâ” from the creek nearby,  where a victory brought him fame.  sadly though,  he caught a cold,  then he up-and-died,  just days beyond his swearing-in â– his white house job untried.    ten  john tyler (1790-1862) served as president between 1841 and 1845  a man of strong convictions,  the kind that fueled the hate â– between the folks of north and south and the war between the states.  the only former president,  who joined the rebelsâ’cause,  by serving in their congress â– where confederates made their laws.   eleven  james polk (1795-1849) served as president between 1845-1849  if you had to pick a president with a knack for adding states,  heâ’s near the lead â– like jefferson â– but not what youâ’d call â“great. â” said he: â“â’been governor from out in tennessee,  but white house work is way too tough â– one termâ’s enough for me. . !â”  twelve  zachary taylor (1784-1850) served as president between 1849-1850  another virginia general,  and hero of the mexican war,  the whigs said: â“please be president, â” old zack said,  â“why â– what for? iâ’ve never even voted,  â‘bout that iâ’ve never lied. â” he won of course,  but got real sick,  and shortly â– old zack died.    thirteen  millard fillmore (1800-1874) served as president between 1850-1853  poor millard â–he was vee pee when president twelve went dead,  that made him number thirteen (a number some folks dread. ) so whatâ’s his contribution,  since his white house time werenâ’t much? itâ’s indoor pipes where water flowed,  and toilets they could flush.   fourteen  franklin pierce (1804-1869) served as president between 1853-1857  this native of new hampshire,  while many thought quite bright,  made piles of poor decisions,  that just plain werenâ’t too right.  when fighting broke in kansas,  with farmers getting killed,  pierce wouldnâ’t send out soldiers,  and folks thought: â“heâ’s bad news. â”  fifteen  james buchanan (1791-1868) served as president between 1857-1861  a man of pennsylvania,  and single all his life,  his niece â– she played first lady and acted like a wife.  hot talk of war was brewing,  but buchanan seemed to feel: â“our nation can survive such talk,  if not â– itâ’s no big deal. â”     sixteen  abraham lincoln (1809-1865) served as president between 1861-1865  so tall in size,  so great was he,  this kind man from the plains: â“the unionâ’s saved,  the slaves â‘been freed,  though blood of soldiers stain those silent fields where armies fought,  that liberty â– remains. â”  seventeen  andrew johnson (1808-1875) served as president between 1865-1869  this senator from tennessee,  (a union man they said) became our nationâ’s president,  with lincoln shot â– and dead.  the congress said,   â“youâ’re awful! get out â– youâ’re just a pain! you never wouldâ’ve had the job had lincoln not been slain!â”  eighteen  ulysses s.  grant (1800-1874) served as president between 1869-1877  itâ’s said this famous general won our civil war,  by giving southern soldiers their dignity - and more: he said: â“boys,  take your horses,  go home and live there free. â” grant even showed great kindness to the rebel general â– lee.      nineteen  rutherford b.  hayes (1822-1893) served as president between 1877-1881  â“iâ’ll only serve but one full term,  like every president should. â” but many scowled and even said,  â“hayes couldnâ’t if he would.  besides we chose that other guy â– we liked him,  heâ’s real good. â” itâ’s true,  in fact â– that hayes had lost by tons of votes that year,  but laws allowed that congress had the right to interfere.   twenty  james garfield (1831-1881) served as president between march 1881 and september of 1881  like harrison and taylor too,  whose terms were both cut short,  this president â– he up and died,  twice shot â– by a crazy sort.  a general in the civil war,  just forty-nine years old,  he dodged the shots from rebel guns,  but this guy got him â– cold.   twenty-one  chester a.  arthur (1829-1886) served as president between 1881-1885  born to an irish preacher,  chester loved to look his best: â“he likes to change his pants a lot. â” â“heâ’s president best dressed. â” a champion of the laws we have for doing government work: â“no longer will you lose your job on whims of elected jerks. â”  twenty-two  grover cleveland (1837-1908) served as president between 1885-1889  so far,  of all our presidents,  this guyâ’s the only one,  who served two terms but split â‘em up â‘tween a one-term â‘publican.  a bachelor â– came he to the white house,  then fell for a good palâ’s kid,  and brought her back from buffalo,  to marry â– which is what they did.   twenty-three  benjamin harrison (1833-1901) served as president between 1889-1893  the last of the civil war generals,  his grandpa was president too.  his term â– it brought some milestones â– like six states added new,  and nature â– showed her cruelties,  though menâ’s were worse to see â– those hundreds drowned in johnstownâ’s flood,  were no-match for wounded knee.   twenty-four  grover cleveland (1837-1908)  served again as president between 1893 and 1897  remember grover cleveland â– the guy with two split terms. . ?? his second was a nightmare â– crises â– what a can of worms. . !! his mouth â– it needed surgery: so they fixed him â– on a boat,  his new jaw was kept secret,  alongside: â“ladies should not vote. â”  twenty-five  william mckinley (1843-1901) served as president between 1897 and 1901  americans loved the twenty-fifth,  as much as america could.  the war with spain was fought and won,  though he had said: â“we should â– not wage war where peace will do,  theyâ’ve done us little harm. â” his last stop â– that was buffalo,  where mckinley â“bought the farm. â”  twenty-six  theodore roosevelt (1858-1919) served as president between 1901 and 1909  the youngest of our presidents,  he loved to be outside,  the giant parks we have out west â– were teddyâ’s joy and pride.  his face looks out from rushmoreâ’s mount,  with greats of awesome fame â– presidents who risked it all,  (somehow â– heâ’s not the same. )  twenty-seven  william howard taft (1857-1930)  served as president between 1909 and 1913  the largest of our presidents,  he walked a leaderâ’s path.  but when he won the white house,  he couldnâ’t fit the bath.  more jobs had taft than he could count: â“iâ’ve done it all â– it seems,  supreme court judge and cabinet jobs,  i ran the philippines. â”     twenty-eight  woodrow wilson (1856-1924) served as president between 1913 and 1921  a solemn man â–a preacherâ’s son: â“iâ’ll not send boys to war. â” but troops did sail â– his second term,  to a far-off foreign shore.  our soldiers fought the kaiserâ’s men,  and in the end we won,  though wilsonâ’s dream of world-wide peace has yet to be â– not done.   twenty-nine  warren harding (1865-1923) served as president between 1921 and 1923  there were those who said that harding got elected on his looks: â“his face â– itâ’s presidential, â” but thatâ’s hardly what it took: he proudly stood for suffrage,  (which means that ladies vote) and when he was a newsman,  folks admired what he wrote.   thirty  calvin coolidge (1872-1933) served as president between 1923 and 1929  the sixth time that a president got tapped because of death,  was vermont son â– cal coolidge (a job weâ’re told he dread).  a thoughtful man â– heâ’d only say exactly what he should,  â“silent calâ” â– they called him and they knew right where he stood.       thirty-one  herbert hoover (1874-1964) served as president between 1929 and 1933  a geologist and a genius type,  devoted to the poor,  but once he earned the white house job,  more got poor â– for sure.  â“he busted our economy, â” so many people said: â“weâ’ve got no jobs. â” â“our homes are gone. â” â“we live in cardboard sheds. â”  thirty-two  franklin delano roosevelt (1882-1945)  served as president between 1929 and 1945  a charming man â– some said had airs: â“itâ’s that funny way he talks. â” four times we chose him president,  (few knew he couldnâ’t walk).  the cruelest war in history,  the whole world now admits,  (â“our greatest fear is fear itselfâ”) was won by this manâ’s wits.   thirty-three  harry s.  truman (1884-1972) served as president between 1945 and 1953  said this senator of missouri: â“i love this job way-much. â” the dems begged,  â“please be vee pee. â” â“no,  iâ’ll be too out of touch. â” he got the job,  three months passed by,  our prez went off to heaven: â“â’seems iâ’m like six veeps before,  that makes me lucky seven. â”   thirty-four  dwight d.  eisenhower (1890-1969)  served as president between 1953 and 1961  a general who in world war two,  became this nationâ’s hero,  was sure to become president: (folks even bet dinero!) â“a college job â– thatâ’s fine for me â– wonâ’t run for no oneâ’s party. â” but ran he did and served two terms,  which left him less-than-hearty.   thirty-five  john f.  kennedy (1917-1963) served as president between 1961 and 1963  his speeches filled our hearts with hope,  the world â– it shed great tears,  when bullets took this president of forty-plus-six years.  a man of faith who loved to sail in cape codâ’s chilly waters,  stood up against a russian threat to harm our sons and daughters.   thirty-six  lyndon baines johnson (1908-1973)  served as president between 1963 and 1969  the eighth vee pee to take the oath,  in a plane at dallas airport,  never planned on white house work: â“jackâ’s young and wonâ’t be cut short. â” a clever man who knew the ways of congress and d. c. ,  drove through laws where civil rights to all were guaranteed.     thirty-seven  richard m.  nixon (1913-1994) served as president between 1969 and 1974  nixon went to china where no prez went before: â“weâ’d like to be more friendly,  letâ’s trade and maybe more. â” our war in southeast asia â– it got on nixonâ’s nerves,  which made for bad decisions,  and a most-brief second term.   thirty-eight  gerald r.  ford (1913-2006) served as president between 1974 and 1977  from michigan to congress,  with a short time as vee pee,  he took the job when nixon was forced to pack and flee.  ford never got elected,  though he sure had lots of friends: â“that jerry is a great guy but on votes that job depends. â”  thirty-nine  jimmy carter (1924-) served as president between 1977 and 1981  a georgia man â– a governor,  a farmer who did well,  â“â’donâ’t make â‘em any nicer, â” what most-folks had to tell.  but carterâ’s time was just one term,  but why?  â“â’forgot to run. â” while others said:  â“his style ainâ’t right. â” â“his listening ainâ’t good,  son. â”    forty  ronald reagan (1911-2004) served as president between 1981 and 1989  not since lincolnâ’s brush with booth had our nation seen an actor,  so caught-up in a white house goal: â“iâ’ll win and write my chapter where folks feel good â– and really proud â– like john wayne in the talkies,  i can see it now â–  theyâ’ll love me lots,  from here to old milwaukee. â”  forty-one  george h. w.  bush  (1924-) served as president between 1989 and 1993  a native of the northeast: â“but iâ’m from texas now!â” his two sons both were governors: â“heâ’s our special dad â– and how!â” but bush â– he left the white house,  got the boot after just one term: â“iâ’ll fix â‘em â– weâ’ll run w,  thatâ’ll teach â‘em what to learn. â”  forty-two  william jefferson clinton (1946-) served as president between 1993 and 2001  a young and handsome president grew up in a trailer park,  and though we like a lot he did heâ’s recalled for a false remark.  the congress â– they impeached him,  but they failed â– no charges stuck,  â“slick willieâ” â– some folks call him,  while others say,  â“what luck!â”          forty-three  george w.  bush  (1946-) serves as president between 2001 to the present  â“i love my mom,  i love my wife,  i love my sister dor.  but â‘gotta say 'supreme-oh court, ' has the folks i most adore: they got me in the white house,  when jebâ’s state hung way-loose,  and had they picked that other guy,  dadâ’ve cooked my goose. â”    a  collection of verses
