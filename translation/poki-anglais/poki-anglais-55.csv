'' and as he lay in his feathery bed,  he thought about taking her on a hike.   now anna was just a girl of sixteen.  but when she saw with her eyes,  so keen,  the boy the innkeeper called john,  she knew that her troubles were gone.   they met the next day,  while in the garden.  the sight of her made him so happy and gay,  and she was happy to have stayed at the inn.   they walked toward each pother,   and stood side-by-side.  the awkwardness seemed like a cover.  while john  thought of the rules to which he was to abide.   finally anna got tired of waiting and broke the silence with one single question,  ''what is your name? i'm very near dying. '' ''my name is john. '' and so it began.   they later described it as love at first sight,   they met in that spot every night.
