119536,The Invisible Man,wi-z,12,"like a phoenix from the ashes,  like the smokes after the lit matches. . .  comes a rising light from the fatal night.  with a kiss from the sun to make the grey skies come alive becoming more beautiful than a sapphire through a beam of light.  conscious comes the imperceptible soul,  veiled to the world and undescribable by a word.  from his throne he rise.  to his head,  a crown of lies.  he is well aware,  as he is wise.  but what is reality to a inconspicuous man who never dies.  with so much awareness trapped in his mind,  he walks the earth with no where to hide.  for he is his guide,  a king with no army behind,  seeking for one to call his kind,  hoping with every wish that one day he shall find.  the more the world passes him by,  the less obscure he is.  now he stands in the midst of median beings unnoticed by one.  a god to the hierarchy of knowledge as he believes he understands everything and everyone around him.  frozen in his thoughts while he stands,  he blinks. . .  the motion of the universe decelerates. . .  slowly the crowd walk pass him,  slowly the tears from the clouds drop to a splash,  and slowly he turns to a flash.  simultaneously blinking for the second time.  as his eyelids folds back to place, . . .  he sees her.  standing beneath the stoplight,  shielded from the rain by the black umbrella she yields.  as he stares fixedly in a state of stun at her beauty and difference,  she turns to look directly at him.  immediately he flinches.  perplexed as to how it is possible that he is visible to her.  or maybe she just looks towards his direction.  but then. . .  she smiled at him. . .  she sees him. . .  turning back to face the crossing light as it begins to countdown,  he blinks for the third time.  the universe accelerates back to it's pace.  as she takes a step and begins to walk,  the crowd moved in intersection to her space.  he takes a deep breathe as he looses sight of her and began to run towards his instincts of her position.  intangible to all in his path,  he moved focused in one direction like a bishop displaced on a chess board.  with his senses channeled in the same course,  the sounds from his surrounding faded to a unified tone.  he caught a glimpse of her.  in reflex and panic,  he said aloud. . .  ''hey!'' as he brakes to a stop,  standing in the middle of the street.  for this moment of decree he would give everything,  his hopes,  his love,  his life.  for one thing.  that she draws to a halt.  immediately, . . .  she did.  turning around to look directly at him as she lifts her fingers to brush the hair obstructing her sight gently behind her ear.  ''hey'' she said.  again. . .  she sees him.  with shock in his heart to the level that could quake his balance,  he says,  ''can you see me''.  in reply with humor she responded with the same words as she smiled.  at the speed of light,  thoughts and emotions flooded his mind,  building pressure enough to liquidate and leak through his eyes.  interrupted by the rumbling horn from the taxi while his heart throbs,  he is gestured to progress to the roadside.  now his senses recovers to his environment.  the unified sound dissociates to a chatter.  she walks towards him.  gently her supple hands wraps around his.  ''c'mon'' she said as she draws him to safety.  does the joy devour the confoundment or does the fear devour the faith.  unsure as to what he feels,  he is certain one thing.  he is not alone.  no longer a king to no kingdom he ran,  no longer trapped in the maze no one began,  and no longer a subtraction from reality as an invisible man.
