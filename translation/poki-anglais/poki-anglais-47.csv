91056,Bio Poem for Fatima Nazir,fatima,7,"fatima; quiet,  helpful,  sensitive,  artistic.  dreams to paint a world of peace,  who brushes strokes of laughter and ease.  wants to cure the sick and poor,  who plans to do that with hard work and much more.  wants to ride on dragons and fly like fairies,  whose wings spread out in the colours of cherries.  whose sword is weak but pen is strong,   whose words say music so ever calm.    who yearns to see every life free,   only filled with love and liberty.  who will work hard until the end,   when she grows old with lousy fashion trends.  who wanders â‘whyâ’ for every question,   unless itâ’s rude and must not be mentioned.   who loves chocolate except the unsugared kind,  who loves to draw with every twist in her mind.  whose mission is to stop fearing insects,  blood &amp; war,  if she were to make peace before it tore.  who plans to abolish ignorance and poverty,  who plans to gain knowledge as one of her priorities.   whose determination will forever inspire,  and whose thoughts of freedom will never retire.  whose final ambition is to create love and peace.
